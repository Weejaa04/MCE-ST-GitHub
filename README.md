# MCE-ST: Classifying Crop Stress using Hyperspectral Data with a Multiscale Conformer Encoder and Spectral-based Tokens

### Code for paper: MCE-ST: Classifying Crop Stress using Hyperspectral Data with a Multiscale Conformer Encoder and Spectral-based Tokens

## Training and Test Process
1. Prepare the environment. We have shared out list of modules for the environment in environmentList.txt
2. Run file main.py to reproduce the result for co(CS) dataset

Note: if you want to test the model with other dataset, you can download the dataset in the dataset repository
